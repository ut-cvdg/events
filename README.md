### Paper Discussion

The one where we meetup to discuss computer vision papers, most of the folks attending this are expected to have read the paper or looked over it earlier. Recently we though it would be nice to get together and talk about CVPR 2023 papers.

### Research Oral

The one where we meetup and hear people talk about their pre-print stage work in a conference-style research oral. Think of it as a standard oral program but for pre-prints.
